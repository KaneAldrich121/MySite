            <h3>A Little About Me:</h3>
            <p>My name is Kane Aldrich, and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Virginia School of Engineering with my Master's in Computer Science. Here's some interesting things about me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I was a Division 1 Pole Vaulter at UVA for four years, my best finish being tying for third at the ACC Championship</li>
                <li>I spent my first 3 years of my time in undergrad as a Philosophy Major.</li>
                <li>The only class I ever switched out of in high school was Computer Science.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you're reading this because I linked this website from a job application, you might be wondering why I would include that last one. I do it to 
                make a simple point. I switched into majoring in Computer Science my senior year of college and I finished on time. The next year I started my 
                Master's Degree and I finished in 3 semesters. I did all this in a subject that I thought I didn't like until I took it for real. My junior 
                year when I took my Intro to Computer Science class I realized that I love this work. I love working on a puzzle, I even love (maybe in hindsight)
                when I'm banging my head into my desk trying to figure out why that one thing just won't work. The point is, this is what I do, and I'm 
                passionate about doing it well.
